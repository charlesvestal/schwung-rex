## File Structure

REX2 files use an IFF (Interchange File Format) container with **big-endian**
byte order throughout.

```
REX2 File
├── CAT header (4 bytes "CAT " + 4-byte length + 4-byte type)
│   ├── GLOB chunk  — tempo, time signature, bars
│   ├── HEAD chunk  — bytes per sample
│   ├── SINF chunk  — sample rate, total decode length
│   ├── SLCE chunk  — slice 0 sample offset
│   ├── SLCE chunk  — slice 1 sample offset
│   ├── ...
│   ├── SDAT chunk  — DWOP-compressed audio
│   └── (other chunks: RECY, etc.)
└── (possible nested CAT containers)
```

Every chunk has this layout:

| Offset | Size | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 0 | 4 | Tag (ASCII, e.g. `"GLOB"`, `"SDAT"`) |
| 4 | 4 | Chunk data length (uint32 big-endian) |
| 8 | N | Chunk data (N = length) |
| 8+N | 0–1 | Padding byte if length is odd (IFF alignment) |

`CAT ` chunks are containers: after the 8-byte header, they have a 4-byte type
identifier followed by nested chunks. The parser recurses into CAT containers
bounded by their declared length.

---

## Chunk Types

### GLOB — Global Metadata

Stores tempo, time signature, and loop structure.

| Offset | Size | Type | Field |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| 0 | 4 | uint32 | (reserved / PPQ-related) |
| 4 | 2 | uint16 | Bars |
| 6 | 1 | uint8 | Beats |
| 7 | 1 | uint8 | Time signature numerator |
| 8 | 1 | uint8 | Time signature denominator |
| 9 | 1 | uint8 | Sensitivity |
| 10 | 2 | uint16 | Gate sensitivity |
| 12 | 2 | uint16 | Gain |
| 14 | 2 | uint16 | Pitch |
| 16 | 4 | uint32 | Tempo in milli-BPM |

Tempo is stored as `BPM × 1000`. For example, 120.0 BPM is stored as `120000`.

Minimum chunk data length: **20 bytes**.

### HEAD — Audio Format Header

| Offset | Size | Type | Field |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| 0–4 | 5 | — | (unknown) |
| 5 | 1 | uint8 | Bytes per sample (typically 2 = 16-bit) |

Minimum chunk data length: **6 bytes**.

### SINF — Sound Information

Core audio format parameters and the total decode length.

| Offset | Size | Type | Field |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| 0 | 1 | uint8 | Channels (1 = mono, 2 = stereo) |
| 1 | 1 | uint8 | Bit depth indicator (3 = 16-bit, 5 = 24-bit) |
| 2 | 2 | uint16 | (unknown) |
| 4 | 2 | uint16 | Sample rate (e.g. 0xAC44 = 44100) |
| 6 | 4 | uint32 | Total sample length in per-channel frames |

The **total sample length** is the number of per-channel frames to decode from
the SDAT data. For mono files, this equals the total int16 sample count. For
stereo files, the SDAT contains interleaved L/R data producing `total × 2`
int16 samples. This count includes a leading warmup region of silent/near-silent
frames before the first slice.

Minimum chunk data length: **10 bytes**. Falls back to 44100 Hz if sample rate
reads as 0.

### SLCE — Slice Definition

Each SLCE chunk defines one slice or transient marker. There is one SLCE chunk
per entry, appearing in order. The chunk data is 11 bytes:

| Offset | Size | Type | Field |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| 0 | 4 | uint32 | Sample offset into decoded PCM buffer |
| 4 | 4 | uint32 | Sample length (1 = transient marker, >1 = audio slice) |
| 8 | 2 | uint16 | Amplitude / sensitivity (0x7FFF = max) |
| 10 | 1 | uint8 | Zero |

The sample offset is an absolute per-channel frame index into the decoded audio.
For example, if the first slice has offset 322, then `decoded[322]` is the first
sample of slice 0 (for mono), or `decoded[322*2]` / `decoded[322*2+1]` for
stereo L/R.

**Real slices vs transient markers:** SLCE entries with `sample_length > 1`
are playable audio slices. Entries with `sample_length = 1` are transient
markers (sub-slice positions used by ReCycle's sensitivity control) and should
be filtered out for playback. Real slice lengths chain together:
`offset[n] + length[n] = offset[next real slice]`.

For example, `120Mono.rx2` has 32 SLCE chunks but only 12 are real audio
slices. The remaining 20 are transient markers interleaved between them.

**Edge case:** If all SLCE entries have `sample_length <= 1` (e.g. a
single-slice file), treat the entire decoded buffer as one slice.

Minimum chunk data length: **8 bytes**.

### SDAT — Compressed Audio

Contains the raw DWOP-compressed bitstream. The entire chunk data is passed
directly to the DWOP decoder. See [DWOP Codec](#dwop-codec) below.

---

## Slice Filtering

Slice lengths **are** stored in the SLCE chunk (bytes 4–7). To get the playable
slice list:

1. Parse all SLCE chunks
2. Discard entries with `sample_length <= 1` (transient markers)
3. The remaining entries are the real audio slices with correct offsets and
   lengths
4. If all entries were discarded, fall back to a single slice covering the
   entire decoded buffer

The real slices form a contiguous chain: the last real slice's
`offset + length` equals `total_sample_length`.

---

## DWOP Codec

### Overview

DWOP (Delta Width Optimized Predictor) is an adaptive lossless audio codec. It
uses 5 linear predictors of increasing order (0th through 4th difference) and
selects the best predictor per sample based on a running energy metric.

The codec operates on a **doubled representation** — internal state values are
2× the actual audio samples. The final output divides by 2.

### Initial State

| Variable | Initial Value | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `S[0..4]` | 0 | Predictor state (doubled) |
| `e[0..4]` | 2560 | Energy trackers |
| `rv` | 2 | Range coder value |
| `ba` | 0 | Range coder bits accumulated |

### Decoding Algorithm

For each output sample:

#### Step 1: Select Predictor

Find the energy index `p` with the smallest energy value. Uses unsigned
comparison; on ties, the lowest index wins (strictly-less-than).

```
p_order = argmin(e[0], e[1], e[2], e[3], e[4])
```

#### Step 2: Compute Quantizer Step

```
step = (min_energy × 3 + 36) >> 7
```

Where `min_energy = e[p_order]`, and `>> 7` is an unsigned right shift by 7.

#### Step 3: Read Unary Code

Read bits from the SDAT stream (MSB-first). Count `0`-bits until a `1`-bit is
encountered. Each `0`-bit accumulates into the value. Every 7 consecutive
zeros, the step size quadruples:

```
acc = 0
cs = step
qc = 7

repeat:
    bit = read_bit()
    if bit == 1: break
    acc += cs
    qc -= 1
    if qc == 0:
        cs = cs × 4
        qc = 7
```

#### Step 4: Range Coder (Remainder)

Adapt the range coder and read the fractional remainder:

```
nb = ba    (previous bits-accumulated)

if cs >= rv:
    while cs >= rv:
        rv = rv × 2
        nb += 1
else:
    nb += 1
    t = rv
    loop:
        rv = t
        t = t / 2
        nb -= 1
        if cs >= t: break

ext = read_bits(nb)     (nb bits, MSB first; 0 if nb <= 0)
co = rv - cs

if ext < co:
    rem = ext
else:
    x = read_bit()
    rem = co + (ext - co) × 2 + x

val = acc + rem
ba = nb                 (save for next sample)
```

#### Step 5: DWOP Zigzag Decode

Convert the unsigned `val` to a signed doubled delta:

```
d = val XOR (-(val AND 1))
```

This maps: `0→0, 1→-2, 2→2, 3→-4, 4→4, 5→-6, ...`

All resulting `d` values are even integers (the doubled representation).

#### Step 6: Update Predictor State

Apply the predictor update using the **mapped** case (see [Predictor
Mapping](#predictor-mapping)):

See [Predictor Update Rules](#predictor-update-rules) below.

#### Step 7: Update Energy Trackers

For each predictor `i` (0–4):

```
abs_S = S[i] XOR (S[i] >> 31)     (arithmetic shift; branchless "cheap abs")
e[i] = e[i] + abs_S - (e[i] >>> 5)  (unsigned right shift by 5)
```

This is an exponential moving average with decay factor 1/32. The "cheap abs"
gives `|S| - 1` for negative values and `|S|` for non-negative — this is
intentional and matches the binary.

#### Step 8: Output

```
output = (int16_t)(S[0] >> 1)      (arithmetic right shift to un-double)
```

### Predictor Mapping

**This is the critical detail.** The energy index does not map directly to the
switch case number. It maps to the **prediction order**:

| Energy Index | Prediction Order | Switch Case | Meaning |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | `d` is raw sample |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | `d` is 1st difference |
| 2 | 2 | **4** | `d` is 2nd difference |
| 3 | 3 | **2** | `d` is 3rd difference |
| 4 | 4 | **3** | `d` is 4th difference |

The mapping array is: **`[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`**

Energy index 2 maps to case 4 (not case 2), energy index 3 maps to case 2 (not
case 3), and energy index 4 maps to case 3 (not case 4). Getting this wrong
causes the decoder to diverge after a few hundred samples when higher-order
predictors are first selected.

### Predictor Update Rules

Let `old[0..4]` be the previous state values. After decoding delta `d`:

**Case 0 — Order 0** (d is the doubled sample):
```
S[0] = d
S[1] = d - old[0]
S[2] = S[1] - old[1]
S[3] = S[2] - old[2]
S[4] = S[3] - old[3]
```

**Case 1 — Order 1** (d is the doubled 1st difference):
```
S[0] = old[0] + d
S[1] = d
S[2] = d - old[1]
S[3] = S[2] - old[2]
S[4] = S[3] - old[3]
```

**Case 4 — Order 2** (d is the doubled 2nd difference):
```
S[1] = old[1] + d
S[0] = old[0] + S[1]
S[2] = d
S[3] = d - old[2]
S[4] = S[3] - old[3]
```

**Case 2 — Order 3** (d is the doubled 3rd difference):
```
S[2] = old[2] + d
S[1] = old[1] + S[2]
S[0] = old[0] + S[1]
S[3] = d
S[4] = d - old[3]
```

**Case 3 — Order 4** (d is the doubled 4th difference):
```
S[3] = old[3] + d
S[2] = old[2] + S[3]
S[1] = old[1] + S[2]
S[0] = old[0] + S[1]
S[4] = d
```

The pattern: for order N, `d` replaces `S[N]` (with appropriate index
remapping), then higher-order states cascade down while lower-order states
integrate up to reconstruct `S[0]`.

### Bit Reader

Bits are read **MSB-first** within each byte, processing bytes sequentially:

```
Byte:     [b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1 b0]
Read order: 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
```

When all 8 bits of a byte are consumed, the next byte is loaded. If the data
stream is exhausted, 0-bits are returned.

### Constants

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Energy init | 2560 (0xA00) | Starting energy for all 5 predictors |
| Range init | 2 | Initial range coder value (`rv`) |
| Step formula | `(e×3+36)>>7` | Quantizer step from energy |
| Unary doubling | ×4 every 7 zeros | `cs <<= 2` when `qc` hits 0 |
| Energy decay | 1/32 | `e >>= 5` subtracted per sample |
| Predictor map | [0,1,4,2,3] | Energy index to switch case |

---

## Stereo Encoding (L/Delta)

Stereo REX2 files (SINF byte 0 = 2) use **L/delta encoding** in the DWOP codec.
The left channel is encoded directly and the right channel encodes the
difference `R - L`.

### Decoding Stereo

1. Initialize two **independent** channel states (each with its own `S[5]`,
   `e[5]`, `rv`, `ba`), sharing a single bitstream reader
2. For each frame:
   - Decode one sample from the L channel state → `L_out`
   - Decode one sample from the R channel state → `R_delta`
   - Output: `L = L_out`, `R = L_out + R_delta`
3. Output is interleaved: `[L0, R0, L1, R1, ...]`

```
br = bitreader(SDAT)
L_state = initial_state()    // S=0, e=2560, rv=2, ba=0
R_state = initial_state()    // independent copy

for each frame:
    L_out   = decode_one_sample(L_state, br)
    R_delta = decode_one_sample(R_state, br)
    output_L = L_out
    output_R = L_out + R_delta
```

Each channel's `decode_one_sample` follows the exact same DWOP algorithm
described above. The bit reader is shared (both channels consume bits from the
same SDAT stream in alternating order), but all predictor/energy/range state is
per-channel.

### Slice Offsets for Stereo

Slice offsets in SLCE chunks are in **per-channel frames**, not total int16
samples. For stereo PCM data stored as interleaved L/R pairs, the PCM index for
frame `f` is `f * 2` (L) and `f * 2 + 1` (R).

---

## Worked Example

For the test file `120Mono.rx2`:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sample rate | 44100 Hz |
| Channels | 1 (mono) |
| Bit depth | 16 |
| Tempo | 120.0 BPM |
| Original tempo | 93.3 BPM |
| Total decode length | 117,760 samples |
| SDAT compressed size | 118,304 bytes |
| Compression ratio | ~1.00× (lossless, audio fills 16 bits) |
| Slice count (IFF) | 32 (includes transient markers) |
| Slice count (SDK) | 10 (audio slices only) |
| First slice offset | 322 samples |
| Warmup region | Samples 0–287 (all zero) |
| Transition region | Samples 288–321 (small ramp-up values) |

First decoded samples at the audio boundary:
```
[288] = -1    (first non-zero)
[312] =  6
[322] = -231  (first audio slice starts here)
[323] = -421
[324] = -410
```

## Implementation Methodology

### Motivation: interoperability on an unsupported platform

Schwung runs on arm64 Linux. The official REX support library (the "REX Shared
Library" / REX SDK) is distributed only as a macOS framework (Mach-O); there is
no Linux build, and it cannot run on the target platform. Reading REX2 files on
arm64 Linux therefore requires an independently written decoder — this is a
genuine interoperability necessity, and it is the reason this work exists.

### How the decoder was produced

This is an **independent reverse-engineering effort for interoperability**, not a
clean-room implementation. The term "clean room" specifically describes a
two-team process in which one team writes a specification from the original and a
separate team implements only from that specification; that wall was not used
here. This decoder was written directly by a single author from observation of
the format. It was derived from:

1. **Binary analysis** of `.rx2` files — inspecting the IFF container structure,
   chunk tags, and compressed bitstream data directly
2. **Black-box testing** — feeding known inputs through the reference decoder and
   observing outputs to infer the algorithm's behavior
3. **Disassembly and LLDB tracing of the public macOS framework** — examining the
   compiled ARM64 machine code of `DecompressMono` and `DecompressStereo` in the
   REX Shared Library to confirm algorithmic details (predictor mapping, range
   coder parameters, stereo L/delta scheme)

No proprietary source code, header files, or SDK libraries were copied, included,
linked, or otherwise incorporated. All shipped code is the author's own original
expression.

### Legal basis and open questions

This section describes the basis for the work and the questions that remain open.
It is not a legal conclusion and not legal advice.

The recognized lawful purpose here is interoperability. The EU Software Directive
(2009/24/EC, Art. 6) permits decompilation to achieve the interoperability of an
independently created program, subject to conditions: the necessary information
was not otherwise readily available, the activity was limited to the parts
necessary to achieve interoperability, and the results are not used to create a
program substantially similar in its expression. In the United States, case law
on intermediate copying for interoperability — notably *Sega v. Accolade* and
*Sony v. Connectix* — has treated such copying as fair use.

Separately, a file format itself — its facts and structure — and the observable
behavior of an algorithm are generally not subject to copyright; the protectable
expression at issue is the original source code, which here is the author's own.

Honest open questions remain. The macOS framework was likely distributed under a
EULA that restricts reverse engineering. The EU interoperability exception can
override such a contractual term where the purpose is genuine interoperability,
but the precise scope of that override is debated and depends on facts and
jurisdiction. Nothing above should be read as asserting that this work is settled
to be lawful in every forum.

## Verification

The decoder was verified by:

1. **LLDB tracing** the `DecompressMono` and `DecompressStereo` functions in the
   REX Shared Library framework (macOS ARM64) to capture reference output buffers
2. Comparing our independently-written decoder output sample-by-sample:
   - **Mono**: 117,760/117,760 exact match (`120Mono.rx2`)
   - **Stereo**: 91,528/91,528 frames exact match (`120Stereo.rx2`)
3. Confirming the decoder does not diverge over the full file length
